To compile, simply run:

    xelatex blackwell-cv.tex

Note that my version also depends on the having the [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) and Garamond Premier Pro fonts, the latter of which is a commercial product. [Crimson Pro](https://github.com/Fonthausen/CrimsonPro) is a good alternative for Garamond.
