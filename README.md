This CV assumes you have the [res.cls](http://ctan.org/pkg/res) file in either your texmf directory structure or, more simply, in the same directory as the tex file. To compile, simply run:

    xelatex blackwell-cv.tex

Note that my version also depends on having "Garamond Premier Pro," which is not installed on most machines by default. You can change the font to another, such as Times New Roman or another serif typeface as you wish. Also, Helvetica Neue comes by default on Macs, but nother other machines.
